## DYNAMIC ALLIANCE SYSTEM

**Relationships are fluid.** Revolutions can happen anywhere. Alignments can shift. The Atlantic Union's backing is partial and conditional. Nothing is permanent.

### Potential Events
- Socialist revolutions in capitalist states
- Counter-revolutions in satellite states
- Coups and leadership changes
- Alliance shifts and betrayals
- Economic crises rippling across borders
- Border incidents creating crises
- Atlantic Union intervention decisions

### Example Headlines

- "TARNOVA PROTESTS SUPPRESSED BY SECURITY FORCES"
- "KORVATH RECEIVES MILITARY AID FROM ATLANTIC UNION"
- "MARZOVIAN NATIONALISTS DEMAND BORDER REVISION"
