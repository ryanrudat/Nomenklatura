## The People's Socialist Republic of America (PSRA)

An alternate history setting where America became a socialist state after a Second American Civil War in the late 1930s.

---

## Historical Timeline

### The Road to Revolution (1929-1936)

**1929:** The Wall Street Crash triggers the Great Depression. Millions lose their jobs, savings, and homes.

**1932:** Herbert Hoover wins re-election, continuing his failed pro-business policies. The Communist Party of America and allied labor unions begin organizing workers into "Labour Councils."

**1933-1935:** As the Depression deepens, membership in workers' unions and the Communist Party swells. Hoover's government responds with increasing repression—breaking strikes, jailing organizers, and deploying the National Guard against protesters.

**1936:** Hoover's draconian policies trigger worker marches on Washington and state capitals. The Labour Councils begin functioning as parallel governments in industrial cities. Armed clashes between workers and National Guard units become common.

### The Second American Civil War (1936-1940)

**1936-1937:** Open warfare erupts between Labour Council militias and Federal/National Guard forces. The industrial Northeast and Great Lakes regions fall quickly to revolutionary forces. The South and rural areas remain contested.

**1938:** The Soviet Union begins covert aid to the revolutionaries—weapons shipped through Mexico, military advisors, and economic support.

**1939:** Federal forces collapse across the country. Hoover's government retreats to a shrinking perimeter around Washington D.C.

**1940:** Revolutionary forces capture Washington. President Hoover and key officials flee to Cuba aboard a Navy destroyer. The People's Socialist Republic of America is proclaimed. In exchange for Soviet aid, the new government cedes eastern Alaska to the USSR.

### The Intervention War (1941-1942)

**1941:** Britain and Canada, alarmed by the socialist victory, launch an intervention to restore the Federal Government. Canadian and British forces cross the border, hoping to link up with loyalist remnants. Imperial Japan, seeing opportunity in the chaos, seizes Hawaii—officially to "protect" Japanese-American residents.

**1941-1942:** The People's Army, hardened by civil war, throws back the British-Canadian invasion. A counteroffensive pushes into Canada itself. British Columbia and Alberta fall to revolutionary forces, becoming the "People's Federated Territory."

**1942:** Britain, overextended and facing colonial unrest, accepts an armistice. The PSRA's borders are established—including the seized Canadian territories.

### The Consolidation (1942-1950)

**1942-1944:** The Consolidation Purges eliminate suspected collaborators, former Federal officials, and "class enemies." Hundreds of thousands are arrested, imprisoned, or executed.

**1942-1945:** Collectivization campaigns transform American agriculture. Independent farmers are forced onto collective farms. Those who resist—labeled "kulaks"—are sent to labor camps in the Mountain Zone.

**1945-1950:** The PSRA consolidates its power, rebuilds the economy along socialist lines, and establishes the institutions of the new state.

### The Present Day (Early 1950s)

The game takes place approximately 10-15 years after the Revolution. The PSRA has survived its founding crises but faces ongoing challenges:

- The government-in-exile in Cuba continues to plot restoration
- Japan occupies Hawaii—American territory with American citizens
- Britain and Canada remain hostile, demanding return of the seized territories
- The Soviet Union expects gratitude and ideological conformity
- Internal factions struggle for power as the founding generation ages

## Government Structure

### The Communist Party of America

The sole legal political party, founded during the civil war. The Party controls all aspects of government and society through the nomenklatura system—lists of positions that can only be held by approved Party members.

### The Politburo

The supreme decision-making body, consisting of 15-25 full and candidate members. The Politburo meets weekly to determine policy on all matters of state.

### The General Secretary

The most powerful person in the nation. While technically "first among equals," the General Secretary exercises near-absolute authority over Party, state, and military. The current General Secretary resides in the Mitchell Compound in central Washington.

### The Central Committee

Several hundred members who meet periodically to ratify Politburo decisions. Membership marks entry into the nomenklatura elite.

### The People's Congress

The legislative body, consisting of delegates from across the country. In practice, it rubber-stamps Politburo decisions, though it retains theoretical authority.

### The Bureau of People's Security (BPS)

The secret police and intelligence service, responsible for internal surveillance, counterintelligence, and suppression of dissent. The Bureau maintains files on millions of citizens and operates an extensive informant network.

### The People's Army

One of the largest military forces in the world, with nuclear weapons, a powerful navy, and an air force capable of global reach. Political commissars serve alongside military commanders to ensure ideological reliability.

## Domestic Zones

The PSRA is divided into seven administrative zones:

### Zone 7: Capital District
**Washington D.C. and environs**

The political heart of the PSRA. The old Federal buildings have been repurposed—the Capitol houses the People's Congress; the White House (renamed the People's House) serves ceremonial functions. The seat of the Politburo, Central Committee, and Bureau of People's Security.

### Zone 1: Northeast Industrial Zone
**Boston to Philadelphia**

The revolution's birthplace. Factories, shipyards, and mills that power the socialist economy. The Party's most reliable political base—workers here remember marching on Washington.

### Zone 2: Great Lakes Zone
**Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee**

The heart of heavy industry. Auto plants converted to tractor factories, steel mills nationalized and expanded. Strong union traditions persist through official Party structures.

### Zone 3: Pacific Zone
**California, Oregon, Washington + People's Federated Territory**

Controls America's Pacific coast and the seized Canadian territories (British Columbia and Alberta). The People's Federated Territory presents unique challenges—a conquered population that resents occupation. Hawaii's Japanese occupation casts a shadow over the entire zone.

### Zone 4: Southern Zone
**Former Confederate states**

The region whose history of slavery and segregation presented unique challenges for the Revolution. Jim Crow was swept away, replaced by enforced socialist equality. The transformation has been dramatic but incomplete.

### Zone 5: Plains Zone
**Texas to the Dakotas**

The agricultural heartland. Vast collective farms have replaced family homesteads. The collectivization campaigns of 1942-1945 left deep scars—farmers who resisted were sent to labor camps. The Plains now produce surplus grain for export.

### Zone 6: Mountain Zone
**Rocky Mountain states**

Mining, resource extraction, and internal exile. The Mountain Zone serves as the PSRA's gulag territory—political prisoners and class enemies contribute their labor to socialist construction in its mines and camps.

## Foreign Relations

### Socialist Allies

**Soviet Union**
The world's first socialist state and revolutionary ally. The USSR provided crucial aid during the civil war and received part of Alaska in return. Relations are complicated by Moscow's expectations of ideological conformity and the PSRA's growing desire for independence.

**Germany (German Socialist Republic)**
In this timeline, the Nazis never rose to power. Social Democrats and Communists united in 1932, and Germany became a socialist republic through democratic transition. Germany is an ally to both the USSR and PSRA, proving that socialism need not mean Soviet domination.

### Capitalist Adversaries

**Cuba (US Government-in-Exile)**
The old Federal Government fled here after the Revolution. President-in-Exile Robert Taft Jr. claims to lead the "legitimate" United States. Britain and Canada recognize the exile government; the PSRA does not. Cuban intelligence operations, funded by London, threaten PSRA security.

**Canada (Dominion of Canada)**
Lost British Columbia and Alberta to the PSRA during the Intervention War. Canadian politics are consumed by revanchism—"the Lost Provinces" dominate every election. The border is the most militarized in the world.

**United Kingdom**
Without World War II to drain their resources, Britain retains much of its colonial empire. They tried to crush the Revolution and failed. Now they lead global opposition to American socialism while managing a restless empire.

**France**
The most unpredictable power in Europe. French politics swing between left and right. A large Communist Party provides both opportunity and concern. France could go socialist—or fascist.

### Fascist Powers

**Italy (Italian Social Republic)**
Mussolini never fell. Without World War II, his fascist regime survives, controlling Italy and much of North Africa. Ideological enemies, but not at war with the PSRA.

**Spain (Spanish State)**
Franco's fascist state, victorious in the Spanish Civil War. Spanish republicans who fought in the American Revolution now live in PSRA territory, plotting return.

### Pacific Powers

**Japan (Empire of Japan)**
Seized Hawaii during the chaos of the civil war. The Empire controls Korea, Manchuria, parts of China, and American Hawaii. Liberating Hawaii is a PSRA national priority that events have not yet permitted.

**China (Republic of China - contested)**
Under Japanese occupation. The Kuomintang government retreated to the interior; Communist guerrillas fight in the north. Whoever helps free China will have enormous influence over its future.

### Neutral Neighbor

**Mexico (United Mexican States)**
Neither socialist nor fully capitalist—a one-party state that helped the Revolution but refuses to join the socialist bloc. Soviet weapons flowed through Mexican ports during the civil war. Keeping Mexico neutral is a PSRA strategic priority.

## Political Factions

### Proletariat Union (formerly "Old Guard")
Keepers of ideological orthodoxy. They remember why the Revolution was fought and resist deviation from socialist principles. They dominate the Party apparatus and security services.

### Youth League
The meritocrats. Rising through competence and dedication via the Communist Youth League. They support policies that reward ability over bloodlines.

### Princelings
The "Red Aristocracy"—descendants of revolutionary heroes. Their families fought in the civil war; doors open for them that remain closed to others.

### People's Provincial Administration (formerly "Regional")
Power built far from Washington. They cultivated networks among local officials and factory directors. When they arrived in the capital, they brought armies of supporters.

### Reformists
They believe the system must adapt to survive. They push for economic reforms, reduced repression, and engagement with the capitalist world.

## Key Themes

### American Socialism
The PSRA blends American cultural elements with Soviet-style governance. Baseball continues; Hollywood produces socialist cinema; jazz plays in workers' clubs. But the secret police watch, the camps fill, and the Party demands loyalty.

### The Legitimacy Question
Two governments claim to be the real United States. The PSRA controls the territory; the government-in-exile claims legal continuity. This fundamental dispute shapes all international relations.

### Unfinished Business
Hawaii remains under Japanese occupation. The seized Canadian territories simmer with resentment. The old order plots in Havana. These unresolved conflicts drive the narrative.

### The Weight of History
The Revolution promised equality and justice. The Purges delivered terror. Collectivization fed the cities by starving the farms. Players navigate a system built on idealism and sustained by brutality.

## Design Philosophy

Nomenklatura presents a dark mirror of American history—exploring what might have happened if the Great Depression had led to revolution rather than reform. The setting allows examination of authoritarian systems, political survival, and the compromises power demands, all through the lens of familiar American geography and culture transformed by socialist revolution.

The tone is grim, bureaucratic, and paranoid—but leavened with dark humor and human moments. Players experience the system from inside, making the same impossible choices that real officials in such regimes faced.
