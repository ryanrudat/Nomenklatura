## The People's Socialist Republic of America (PSRA)

An alternate history setting where America became a socialist state after a Second American Civil War in the late 1930s.

---

## Historical Timeline

### The Road to Revolution (1929-1936)

**1929:** The Wall Street Crash triggers the Great Depression. Millions lose their jobs, savings, and homes.

**1932:** Herbert Hoover wins re-election, continuing his failed pro-business policies. The Communist Party of America and allied labor unions begin organizing workers into "Labour Councils."

**1933-1935:** As the Depression deepens, membership in workers' unions and the Communist Party swells. Hoover's government responds with increasing repression—breaking strikes, jailing organizers, and deploying the National Guard against protesters.

**1936:** Hoover's draconian policies trigger worker marches on Washington and state capitals. The Labour Councils begin functioning as parallel governments in industrial cities. Armed clashes between workers and National Guard units become common.

### The Second American Civil War (1936-1940)

**1936-1937:** Open warfare erupts between Labour Council militias and Federal/National Guard forces. The industrial Northeast and Great Lakes regions fall quickly to revolutionary forces. The South and rural areas remain contested.

**1938:** The Soviet Union begins covert aid to the revolutionaries—weapons shipped through Mexico, military advisors, and economic support.

**1939:** Federal forces collapse across the country. Hoover's government retreats to a shrinking perimeter around Washington D.C.

**1940:** Revolutionary forces capture Washington. President Hoover and key officials flee to Cuba aboard a Navy destroyer. The People's Socialist Republic of America is proclaimed. In exchange for Soviet aid, the new government cedes eastern Alaska to the USSR.

### The Intervention War (1941-1942)

**1941:** Britain and Canada, alarmed by the socialist victory, launch an intervention to restore the Federal Government. Canadian and British forces cross the border, hoping to link up with loyalist remnants. Imperial Japan, seeing opportunity in the chaos, seizes Hawaii—officially to "protect" Japanese-American residents.

**1941-1942:** The People's Army, hardened by civil war, throws back the British-Canadian invasion. A counteroffensive pushes into Canada itself. British Columbia and Alberta fall to revolutionary forces, becoming the "People's Federated Territory."

**1942:** Britain, overextended and facing colonial unrest, accepts an armistice. The PSRA's borders are established—including the seized Canadian territories.

### The Consolidation (1942-1950)

**1942-1944:** The Consolidation Purges eliminate suspected collaborators, former Federal officials, and "class enemies." Hundreds of thousands are arrested, imprisoned, or executed.

**1942-1945:** Collectivization campaigns transform American agriculture. Independent farmers are forced onto collective farms. Those who resist—labeled "kulaks"—are sent to labor camps in the Mountain Zone.

**1945-1950:** The PSRA consolidates its power, rebuilds the economy along socialist lines, and establishes the institutions of the new state.

### The Present Day (Early 1950s)

The game takes place approximately 10-15 years after the Revolution. The PSRA has survived its founding crises but faces ongoing challenges:

- The government-in-exile in Cuba continues to plot restoration
- Japan occupies Hawaii—American territory with American citizens
- Britain and Canada remain hostile, demanding return of the seized territories
- The Soviet Union expects gratitude and ideological conformity
- Internal factions struggle for power as the founding generation ages

## Government Structure

### The Communist Party of America

The sole legal political party, founded during the civil war. The Party controls all aspects of government and society through the nomenklatura system—lists of positions that can only be held by approved Party members.

### The Politburo

The supreme decision-making body, consisting of 15-25 full and candidate members. The Politburo meets weekly to determine policy on all matters of state.

### The General Secretary

The most powerful person in the nation. While technically "first among equals," the General Secretary exercises near-absolute authority over Party, state, and military. The current General Secretary resides in the Mitchell Compound in central Washington.

### The Central Committee

Several hundred members who meet periodically to ratify Politburo decisions. Membership marks entry into the nomenklatura elite.

### The People's Congress

The legislative body, consisting of delegates from across the country. In practice, it rubber-stamps Politburo decisions, though it retains theoretical authority.

### The Bureau of People's Security (BPS)

The secret police and intelligence service, responsible for internal surveillance, counterintelligence, and suppression of dissent. The Bureau maintains files on millions of citizens and operates an extensive informant network.

### The People's Army

One of the largest military forces in the world, with nuclear weapons, a powerful navy, and an air force capable of global reach. Political commissars serve alongside military commanders to ensure ideological reliability.

---

## Domestic Zones

The PSRA is divided into seven administrative zones:

### Zone 7: Capital District
**Washington D.C. and environs**

The political heart of the PSRA. The old Federal buildings have been repurposed—the Capitol houses the People's Congress; the White House (renamed the People's House) serves ceremonial functions. The seat of the Politburo, Central Committee, and Bureau of People's Security.

### Zone 1: Northeast Industrial Zone
**Boston to Philadelphia**

The revolution's birthplace. Factories, shipyards, and mills that power the socialist economy. The Party's most reliable political base—workers here remember marching on Washington.

### Zone 2: Great Lakes Zone
**Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee**

The heart of heavy industry. Auto plants converted to tractor factories, steel mills nationalized and expanded. Strong union traditions persist through official Party structures.

### Zone 3: Pacific Zone
**California, Oregon, Washington + People's Federated Territory**

Controls America's Pacific coast and the seized Canadian territories (British Columbia and Alberta). The People's Federated Territory presents unique challenges—a conquered population that resents occupation. Hawaii's Japanese occupation casts a shadow over the entire zone.

### Zone 4: Southern Zone
**Former Confederate states**

The region whose history of slavery and segregation presented unique challenges for the Revolution. Jim Crow was swept away, replaced by enforced socialist equality. The transformation has been dramatic but incomplete.

### Zone 5: Plains Zone
**Texas to the Dakotas**

The agricultural heartland. Vast collective farms have replaced family homesteads. The collectivization campaigns of 1942-1945 left deep scars—farmers who resisted were sent to labor camps. The Plains now produce surplus grain for export.

### Zone 6: Mountain Zone
**Rocky Mountain states**

Mining, resource extraction, and internal exile. The Mountain Zone serves as the PSRA's gulag territory—political prisoners and class enemies contribute their labor to socialist construction in its mines and camps.

---

## Foreign Relations

### Socialist Allies

**Soviet Union**
The world's first socialist state and revolutionary ally. The USSR provided crucial aid during the civil war and received part of Alaska in return. Relations are complicated by Moscow's expectations of ideological conformity and the PSRA's growing desire for independence.

**Germany (German Socialist Republic)**
In this timeline, the Nazis never rose to power. Social Democrats and Communists united in 1932, and Germany became a socialist republic through democratic transition. Germany is an ally to both the USSR and PSRA, proving that socialism need not mean Soviet domination.

### Capitalist Adversaries

**Cuba (US Government-in-Exile)**
The old Federal Government fled here after the Revolution. President-in-Exile Robert Taft Jr. claims to lead the "legitimate" United States. Britain and Canada recognize the exile government; the PSRA does not. Cuban intelligence operations, funded by London, threaten PSRA security.

**Canada (Dominion of Canada)**
Lost British Columbia and Alberta to the PSRA during the Intervention War. Canadian politics are consumed by revanchism—"the Lost Provinces" dominate every election. The border is the most militarized in the world.

**United Kingdom**
Without World War II to drain their resources, Britain retains much of its colonial empire. They tried to crush the Revolution and failed. Now they lead global opposition to American socialism while managing a restless empire.

**France**
The most unpredictable power in Europe. French politics swing between left and right. A large Communist Party provides both opportunity and concern. France could go socialist—or fascist.

### Fascist Powers

**Italy (Italian Social Republic)**
Mussolini never fell. Without World War II, his fascist regime survives, controlling Italy and much of North Africa. Ideological enemies, but not at war with the PSRA.

**Spain (Spanish State)**
Franco's fascist state, victorious in the Spanish Civil War. Spanish republicans who fought in the American Revolution now live in PSRA territory, plotting return.

### Pacific Powers

**Japan (Empire of Japan)**
Seized Hawaii during the chaos of the civil war. The Empire controls Korea, Manchuria, parts of China, and American Hawaii. Liberating Hawaii is a PSRA national priority that events have not yet permitted.

**China (Republic of China - contested)**
Under Japanese occupation. The Kuomintang government retreated to the interior; Communist guerrillas fight in the north. Whoever helps free China will have enormous influence over its future.

### Neutral Neighbor

**Mexico (United Mexican States)**
Neither socialist nor fully capitalist—a one-party state that helped the Revolution but refuses to join the socialist bloc. Soviet weapons flowed through Mexican ports during the civil war. Keeping Mexico neutral is a PSRA strategic priority.

---

## Political Factions

### Proletariat Union (formerly "Old Guard")
Keepers of ideological orthodoxy. They remember why the Revolution was fought and resist deviation from socialist principles. They dominate the Party apparatus and security services.

### Youth League
The meritocrats. Rising through competence and dedication via the Communist Youth League. They support policies that reward ability over bloodlines.

### Princelings
The "Red Aristocracy"—descendants of revolutionary heroes. Their families fought in the civil war; doors open for them that remain closed to others.

### People's Provincial Administration (formerly "Regional")
Power built far from Washington. They cultivated networks among local officials and factory directors. When they arrived in the capital, they brought armies of supporters.

### Reformists
They believe the system must adapt to survive. They push for economic reforms, reduced repression, and engagement with the capitalist world.

---

## Key Themes

### American Socialism
The PSRA blends American cultural elements with Soviet-style governance. Baseball continues; Hollywood produces socialist cinema; jazz plays in workers' clubs. But the secret police watch, the camps fill, and the Party demands loyalty.

### The Legitimacy Question
Two governments claim to be the real United States. The PSRA controls the territory; the government-in-exile claims legal continuity. This fundamental dispute shapes all international relations.

### Unfinished Business
Hawaii remains under Japanese occupation. The seized Canadian territories simmer with resentment. The old order plots in Havana. These unresolved conflicts drive the narrative.

### The Weight of History
The Revolution promised equality and justice. The Purges delivered terror. Collectivization fed the cities by starving the farms. Players navigate a system built on idealism and sustained by brutality.

## The Lost Territories

### Hawaii (Japanese Occupation)

**The Fall of Hawaii (1941)**

When the Second American Civil War consumed the mainland, Hawaii's military garrison was recalled to fight revolutionary forces. Japan, seeing opportunity, landed troops in December 1941 under the pretext of "protecting Japanese-American residents from revolutionary chaos."

The occupation was swift. Pearl Harbor's skeleton crew offered token resistance. Within weeks, the Rising Sun flew over Honolulu.

**Life Under Occupation**

Japanese military government rules Hawaii with an iron fist:
- **Japanese-Americans** initially welcomed as liberators, now serve as collaborator class
- **White Americans** stripped of property, confined to designated districts
- **Native Hawaiians** granted nominal autonomy in exchange for cooperation
- **Chinese and Filipino workers** pressed into labor battalions

The Japanese renamed Honolulu to "Honouru" and erected Shinto shrines beside Christian churches. English newspapers were shut down; Japanese became the language of government.

**The PSRA Position**

"Free Hawaii" remains a rallying cry. The People's Army maintains plans for amphibious invasion—Operation Pacific Dawn—but lacks the naval capacity to challenge the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Pacific Fleet, what survived the civil war, was largely scuttled to prevent capture.

Every Party Congress renews the pledge: Hawaii will be liberated. Every year, the pledge goes unfulfilled.

**Strategic Significance**

Hawaii gives Japan:
- Forward naval base threatening the Pacific Coast
- Submarine patrols interdicting PSRA shipping
- Intelligence operations targeting California
- Propaganda victory: "Even Japan treats its subjects better than American communists"

### Eastern Alaska (Soviet Territory)

**The Price of Revolution**

In 1940, the Revolutionary Council signed the Bering Strait Agreement, ceding eastern Alaska to the Soviet Union. The price: continued weapons shipments, economic aid, and diplomatic recognition. The territory east of the 157th meridian—including Fairbanks, the Alaskan interior, and the Canadian border—became Soviet.

**Soviet Alaska Today**

The Soviets renamed eastern Alaska the "Bering Socialist Republic" and incorporated it into the Russian SFSR. The territory serves multiple purposes:
- **Military bases** facing the Pacific and Arctic
- **Resource extraction** (gold, oil, timber)
- **Labor camps** for Soviet political prisoners (far from prying eyes)
- **Buffer zone** protecting Soviet Far East

American residents were given a choice: Soviet citizenship or deportation to the PSRA. Most left. Those who stayed—trappers, miners, indigenous peoples—now live under Soviet law.

**The Alaska Question**

The cession remains deeply unpopular within the PSRA. Reformists whisper that a future renegotiation might recover the territory. Hardliners insist the debt to the Soviet Union was paid in full with American blood. The General Secretary's position: the matter is closed.

But in private, every American official knows: the Revolution sold American soil to a foreign power. That stain does not wash out.

## Religion and Cultural Transformation

### The War on Faith

**The Suppression Campaign (1940-1948)**

America in 1936 was the most religious nation in the industrialized world. Protestant denominations, the Catholic Church, Jewish communities, and countless smaller faiths wove through every aspect of American life.

The Party viewed organized religion as a threat: an alternative source of authority, a refuge for reactionary thought, a competitor for the people's loyalty.

**Phase One: Separation (1940-1942)**
- Church property nationalized "for the people"
- Religious schools closed or converted to secular education
- Clergy required to register with the Bureau of People's Security
- Religious holidays removed from official calendars

**Phase Two: Suppression (1942-1946)**
- "Militant atheism" campaigns in factories and schools
- League of the Godless established to combat "superstition"
- Prominent religious leaders arrested on charges of collaboration with the old regime
- Church buildings converted to "Houses of Culture," warehouses, or demolished

**Phase Three: Accommodation (1946-present)**
- Surviving religious institutions placed under state control
- "Patriotic" church councils installed to ensure loyalty
- Limited worship permitted for elderly believers
- Underground churches emerge despite severe penalties

### Religious Landscape Today

**Protestantism**
The mainline Protestant denominations were devastated. The Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian churches either submitted to state control or went underground. "Patriotic Protestant Churches" hold government-approved services; real believers meet in basements.

**Catholicism**
The Catholic Church, with its foreign allegiance to Rome, was treated with particular suspicion. The Vatican condemned the Revolution; the PSRA severed relations. American Catholics who refused to join the "Patriotic Catholic Church" face prison. Underground priests celebrate mass in secret, smuggling in consecrated hosts from Mexico.

**Judaism**
Jewish communities faced a paradox: many revolutionary leaders were Jewish (Director Wallace, Secretary Hoffman), but Jewish religious practice was suppressed alongside Christianity. Synagogues became cultural centers; the Yiddish language was preserved while Hebrew prayer was forbidden. Jewish identity survives; Jewish faith struggles.

**African-American Churches**
Black churches, long centers of community resistance, initially supported the Revolution's promise of equality. The betrayal came swiftly: churches were closed, pastors arrested, spirituals replaced with socialist anthems. The destruction of Black religious institutions remains one of the Revolution's deepest wounds in the Southern Zone.

### Cultural Transformation

**What Survived**
- **Baseball** continues as the national pastime, now with Party-sponsored teams
- **Jazz** was initially condemned as "decadent" but proved impossible to suppress; it's now "proletarian music"
- **Hollywood** produces socialist cinema—historical epics about the Revolution, worker heroes, anti-capitalist dramas
- **Thanksgiving** was rebranded as "Harvest Festival," celebrating collective farming
- **July 4th** is now "Liberation Day," commemorating the Revolution's victory

**What Was Destroyed**
- **Christmas** banned as religious superstition (though "Winter Festival" gift-giving quietly continues)
- **Easter** replaced with "Spring Labor Day"
- **Private charity** eliminated—the state provides; individual charity implies state failure
- **Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts** replaced by Young Pioneers
- **Fraternal orders** (Masons, Elks, etc.) dissolved as "bourgeois conspiracies"

**The New Culture**
Socialist Realism dominates all art. Heroic workers, wise Party leaders, and villainous capitalists populate every painting, novel, and film. Abstract art is forbidden. Jazz survives because workers demanded it—a rare victory of popular culture over ideological purity.

## Soviet-PSRA Relations: The Growing Rift

### The Debts of Revolution

The PSRA owes its existence to Soviet aid. Without Moscow's weapons, advisors, and recognition, the Revolution might have failed. This debt shapes everything.

**What the Soviets Provided (1938-1942)**
- 500,000 rifles and machine guns via Mexican ports
- Artillery, tanks, and aircraft flown through Alaska
- Military advisors who trained the People's Army
- $2 billion in economic credits (never fully repaid)
- Diplomatic recognition that legitimized the new government

**What the Soviets Received**
- Eastern Alaska (the Bering Strait Agreement)
- Favorable trade agreements (American grain, manufactured goods)
- A powerful ally in the Western Hemisphere
- Ideological validation: capitalism could fall even in America

### Points of Tension

**Ideological Conformity**
Moscow expects the PSRA to follow Soviet ideological leadership. American communists, however, developed their own revolutionary theory during the civil war. The Party's founding documents blend Marxism-Leninism with American populist traditions. Soviet advisors call this "deviationism."

**Economic Independence**
The PSRA's industrial capacity exceeds the Soviet Union's in many sectors. American factories, now nationalized, produce goods Moscow wants. The Soviets pressure for favorable trade terms; the PSRA resists being treated as an economic colony.

**The Alaska Question**
Publicly, the cession of Alaska is settled. Privately, American officials resent it. The territory was given in desperation; now that the PSRA is strong, some wonder if it might be recovered. Any such suggestion infuriates Moscow.

**The German Example**
Socialist Germany achieved its revolution through democratic means, not Soviet intervention. Germany proves socialism need not mean Soviet domination. The PSRA increasingly looks to Berlin as a model—and Moscow notices.

**Military Command**
Soviet military advisors remain embedded in the People's Army. They push for integration of command structures, shared intelligence, and coordination of war plans. American generals resist subordination to Moscow's strategic goals.

### The Current State (Early 1950s)

Relations remain officially warm. Premier Malenkov and General Secretary Mitchell exchange fraternal greetings. Trade continues. Military cooperation proceeds.

But the cracks are visible:
- Soviet advisors complain of American "exceptionalism"
- American officials chafe at Moscow's expectations of gratitude
- Reformists whisper about a "third way" between Soviet orthodoxy and capitalism
- Hardliners in both countries push for tighter ideological discipline

The break, if it comes, will reshape the world. For now, both sides paper over differences. But everyone knows: the PSRA is growing strong enough to chart its own course.

## Regional Ethnic Identities

### The Immigrant Mosaic

America's ethnic diversity, built by waves of immigration, did not disappear with the Revolution. It was transformed, suppressed in some ways and channeled in others.

### Northeast Industrial Zone

**Irish-Americans**
Boston's Irish population, long associated with the Democratic Party and Catholic Church, split during the Revolution. Working-class Irish largely supported the uprising; middle-class Irish often opposed it. The suppression of the Catholic Church devastated Irish-American communities. Irish cultural identity survives through secular organizations; Irish religious identity went underground.

**Italian-Americans**
New York and Philadelphia's Italian communities faced suspicion due to Mussolini's Italy. "Patriotic Italian-American Clubs" were established to demonstrate loyalty. Italian anarchist traditions, however, contributed significantly to revolutionary theory. Italian-American workers were among the most militant supporters of the Revolution.

**Jewish-Americans**
The Northeast's large Jewish population provided many revolutionary leaders. Jewish labor organizations—the Bund, the ILGWU—were instrumental in the uprising. This created a paradox: Jews are overrepresented in the Party elite while Jewish religious practice is suppressed. Anti-semitic undercurrents, officially forbidden, persist in whispers.

### Great Lakes Zone

**Polish-Americans**
Detroit, Chicago, and Milwaukee's Polish communities brought strong union traditions. Solidarity with workers' struggles in Poland (now Soviet-aligned) is officially encouraged. Polish cultural organizations flourish; Polish Catholic practice is forbidden. The community remembers that many Polish-American priests died in the Purges.

**German-Americans**
Once the largest immigrant group, German-Americans were rehabilitated after the Revolution. No Nazi stigma exists in this timeline; instead, German-Americans point proudly to Socialist Germany as proof of their progressive heritage.

**Scandinavian-Americans**
Minnesota and Wisconsin's Scandinavian populations, with their cooperative traditions, adapted relatively well to collectivization. Lutheran churches were closed, but Scandinavian cultural associations continue.

### Southern Zone

**African-Americans**
The Revolution promised liberation from Jim Crow, and in many ways delivered. Legal segregation was abolished; Black workers received equal access to unions and factories. But the destruction of Black churches and the suppression of Black independent organizations robbed the community of autonomous institutions. Integration came at the cost of cultural independence.

Party rhetoric celebrates "the unity of the working class." Black leaders who emphasize racial identity over class solidarity are accused of "bourgeois nationalism." The Great Migration accelerated—millions moved North, not fleeing segregation but seeking industrial jobs in a supposedly equal society.

**Mexican-Americans**
Texas and the Southwest's Mexican-American population maintains ties to neutral Mexico. This makes them simultaneously valuable (connections to a friendly neighbor) and suspect (potential disloyalty). Spanish-language newspapers are permitted; the Party actively recruits Mexican-American cadres.

### Pacific Zone

**Asian-Americans**
Chinese and Filipino communities on the West Coast are treated with suspicion due to Japanese occupation of Hawaii. Japanese-Americans face the worst: despite their loyalty during the civil war, they are viewed as potential fifth columnists. Many were relocated to the interior during the Intervention War; most have not been allowed to return.

**Indigenous Peoples**
Native American nations were promised autonomy by the Revolutionary Council. Reality proved different. Reservations were collectivized; tribal governance was subordinated to Party structures. Some tribes collaborated, hoping to preserve what they could. Others resisted and were crushed.

### The People's Federated Territory (Former Canada)

**Conquered Canadians**
British Columbia and Alberta's population did not choose socialism. They were conquered. Fourteen years later, resentment simmers. English-speaking Canadians dream of return to Canada; the PSRA responds with settlement programs, bringing American workers north.

The Party attempts assimilation: "Canadian and American workers are one." The conquered population disagrees. Underground networks maintain contact with free Canada. The BPS monitors constantly.

### Official Policy: "One People, One Class"

The Party's position on ethnic identity is clear: national and ethnic distinctions are bourgeois relics. All Americans—regardless of origin—are members of the working class first. Ethnic cultural expressions are permitted (folk dancing, ethnic cuisine, language preservation) so long as they don't challenge class unity.

In practice, ethnic networks persist through Party-approved organizations. The Polish Workers' Association, the Italian-American Labor League, the Negro Advancement Congress—all are Party-controlled but all preserve some community identity.

The melting pot did not disappear. It was repainted red.

## Design Philosophy

Nomenklatura presents a dark mirror of American history—exploring what might have happened if the Great Depression had led to revolution rather than reform. The setting allows examination of authoritarian systems, political survival, and the compromises power demands, all through the lens of familiar American geography and culture transformed by socialist revolution.

The tone is grim, bureaucratic, and paranoid—but leavened with dark humor and human moments. Players experience the system from inside, making the same impossible choices that real officials in such regimes faced.
